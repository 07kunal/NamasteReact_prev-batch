chapter 2 igniting the app
key points:-
-making our app better
-virtual Dom
-ignite app , make our app to deploy on production.

Question : how amasing would it be that we build our own create app in react JS?
// create our own 
we need the following things to make production ready.
minify the file of our app,
bundle the dependencies
and server 
inshort - minify-app,optimisation, bundle of app , clean the console, and server
//Bundler: webpack, parcel, vite. 
->parcel is easy to learn faste from vite. all the Bundler uses same approach to optimise the code etc.
//package
-> it's like predefine code that we use in out app, by installing it. but we need package-manager
to manage such file.

how to initialise the node package manager ( not offical name by the company)
npm init -y
npm install -D parcel( bundler)
//what is package-lock.json and devDependencies?
-> devDependencies are used in development enviroment.
->package-lock: it basically specify the exact version of exiting package in our project. which help us to maintain the project on production mode.

what is node_modules?
->when we install the require packages into our project then they install into the node_modules but the specific package which we install depend upon the other packages and install other packages as well as per availability.

what is the new way to install the react into project apart from the cdn links?
-> npm install react

how to ignite our app to percel app.
npx parcel index.html(entry point)
//what parcel do?
->created a server/ enable the hot module replacement
->HMR - Hot module replacement
->file watcher algorithm
Bundling
minify
cleaning our code
dev and production build
super fast build algorithm
image optimisation
caching while development
compression some file name
compatble with older version of browser
it also give the functionality to work on HTTPS on dev enviroment
port number with different project create
consistant hashing algorithms
zero config


//Note :- We have our package manager which will hold or take care of our transitive dependencies.

//note :- to remove anything from the git ignore file
git rm -r --cached node_modules

git commit -am "node_modules be gone!"

git push origin master
